RESULTS INTERPRETATION (Quant-style)
Date: 2026-02-05

Headline results
- The optimized strategy underperformed the equal‑weight benchmark.
- Sharpe ratio and returns were worse for the optimized strategy.
- Drawdowns were larger for the optimized strategy.
- Turnover was dramatically higher for the optimized strategy.

Interpretation
1) Underperformance is plausible
  - Synthetic data has no true edge; equal‑weight often looks strong because it avoids estimation error.
  - Mean return estimates are noisy; optimizers can overfit short‑window noise.

2) High turnover is a red flag
  - Frequent 10‑day rebalancing can cause weight churn.
  - Transaction costs punish high turnover and can dominate any small alpha.

3) Risk/return profile indicates instability
  - Negative Sharpe and larger drawdowns suggest risk without adequate compensation.
  - This is consistent with overfitting to short‑term signals.

4) Regime stability signals weak robustness
  - Outperformance across regimes was 0% in this run.
  - That suggests the current parameterization is not stable across conditions.

Bottom line
- The system runs correctly, but this specific run does not show robust alpha.
- This is a normal early‑stage outcome; it indicates parameters and assumptions need refinement.
